## Introduction:
This is a Power Bi project on Data Analyst for Dano Airlines, a Uk-based airline
headquartered in London, United Kingdom. The latest passenger survey results just came in and it looks
like the satisfaction rate dipped under 50% for the first time ever. The leadership team needs to take
action fast, hence the need for the data analysis and to find the key areas to focus on for getting
back on track.

## Problem Statement:
1. Recommend a data driven strategy for increasing Dano Airlines' satisfaction rate and
2. Present it in the form of a single page report or dashboard.
